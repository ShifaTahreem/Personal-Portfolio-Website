    <ul>
        <li>Project 1 –<p>DATA-PIPELINE DEVELOPMENT</p>
                       <p>LINK:https://github.com/ShifaTahreem/DATA-PIPELINE-DEVELOPMENT</p>
                       <p>ABOUT:The objective of this project was to simulate a real-world data engineering scenario where raw data needs to be cleaned, processed, and stored in a usable format for analysis or machine learning. The ETL process is crucial in almost all data-related workflows — whether in data science, machine learning, or business intelligence. Through this task, I aimed to gain hands-on experience with the key steps involved in data processing:

Extracting raw data from a source file (CSV format).

Transforming the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

Loading the final cleaned data into a new CSV file for future use. </p></li>
        <li>Project 2 – <p>HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION</p>
                      <p> LINK:https://github.com/ShifaTahreem/house-price-prediction</p>
                       <p>ABOUT:House price prediction is a common real-world use case in the domain of machine learning, especially in the real estate sector. This project demonstrates how raw data can be transformed into an intelligent system that can provide instant predictions using a machine learning model hosted through a web application.</p></li>
